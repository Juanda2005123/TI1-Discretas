// The code snippet is defining an enumeration called `PriorityLevel`. An enumeration is a special type
// in Java that represents a fixed set of constants. In this case, the `PriorityLevel` enumeration has
// five constants: `NON`, `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`, and `IMMEDIATE`. These constants can be used to
// represent different levels of priority in a system or application.
public enum PriorityLevel {
    
    NON, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, IMMEDIATE;
    
}

// The code snippet is defining an enumeration called `DataType`. An enumeration is a special type in
// Java that represents a fixed set of constants. In this case, the `DataType` enumeration has three
// constants: `ADD`, `DELETE`, and `MODIFY`. These constants can be used to represent different types
// of data operations, such as adding, deleting, or modifying data.
public enum DataType {
    ADD, DELETE, MODIFY;
